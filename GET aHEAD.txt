SOLUTION : 

	The title of the challenge is "GET aHEAD", at frist we can think there is something hidden in the head.
	and lets see the hint.
	Hint 1: Maybe you have more than 2 choices
	
	let us look at the HTML code for this
	PRESS F12 (OR) RIGHT CLICK --> INSPECT

      
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Red</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
	<style>body {background-color: red;}</style>
</head>
	<body>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
						<div class="panel-heading">
							<h3 class="panel-title" style="color:red">Red</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<form action="index.php" method="GET">
								<input type="submit" value="Choose Red"/>
							</form>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
						<div class="panel-heading">
							<h3 class="panel-title" style="color:blue">Blue</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<form action="index.php" method="POST">
								<input type="submit" value="Choose Blue"/>
							</form>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
	
	
	now we can see there are two methods.
	"GET" -- RED
	"POST"--BLUE
	so the hint is probably referring to a third method and lets try it with "HEAD" as it is in the title.
	let's try "HEAD" request

	curl -I HEAD -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php

	curl : A command line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP,
		 FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP,
		 SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP. libcurl offers a myriad of powerful features

		which stands for client URL, is a command line tool that developers use to transfer data to and from 
		a server. At the most fundamental, cURL lets you talk to a server by specifying the location 
		(in the form of a URL) and the data you want to send

	-I HEAD : "-I" show document info only of HEAD 

	-i http.... : "-i" include , include in the url "http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php"

OUTPUT: 
	
	flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_2e5ba39f}

NOTE:
	the url "http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php" will be different for diffenrnt users so check the url 
	while solving.
